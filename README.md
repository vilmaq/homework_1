# Horiseon Project 
## Description 
This homework aims to refactor a website code to be more descriptive. We have achieved this thanks to semantic HTML elements.

Changes done to the index.html file:
1. change first <div> element to <header>
2. change last <div> element to <footer>
3. change the third <div> which is responsible for the navigation of the page to <nav>
4. Add a main element to main content 
5. Add sections inside the main element (replace the respective div elements with section elements)
6. Add aside element for the benefits
7. Add section elements for the respective benefits 
8. Add alt attributes for the respective images inside the benefits sections
9. Fix nav link to search-engine-optimization

Changes to style.css
1. update div with nav to match the change on point 3 from the html file
2. Replace repetitive attributes for different selectors with a list of selectors (classes)
